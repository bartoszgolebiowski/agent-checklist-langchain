  "message": "Your comprehensive guitar learning checklist is now ready, designed as a systems-thinking roadmap to take you from beginner to confident player. It starts with essential open chords in bite-sized phases to build strength without frustration, expands to core progressions tied to real songs for quick wins, applies them in musical contexts, and ends with variations to fuel creativity and prevent plateaus. Highlights include limiting initial overload by focusing on just four chords first, daily short drills for retention, and logs to track your steady progress—all backed by proven methods to slash overwhelm and boost motivation. If you have questions about adapting this to your setup, specific songs, or pace, just let me know.",
